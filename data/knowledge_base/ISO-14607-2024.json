Establish the new load levels until there is a tight range between only runouts and a higher load\nlevel with first ruptures. The rRange between these neighbouring load levels should be approximately 10 %.\nThe recommended maximum -value for cyclic testing is 0,5 in order to increaseR comparability of different\nproducts. When choRosing a lower -value of e.g. 0,25 or 0,1, the amplitude becomes higher, possibly leading to\nearlier failure. This limits comparability but is deemed acceptable since a lower -value is more challenging\nto the product.

Establish the new load levels until there is a tight range between only runouts and a higher load level with first ruptures. The rRange between these neighbouring load levels should be approximately 10 %. The recommended maximum -value for cyclic testing is 0,5 in order to increaseR comparability of different products. When choRosing a lower -value of e.g. 0,25 or 0,1, the amplitude becomes higher, possibly leading to earlier failure.

The source of the expected lifetime information should be provided, for example, from analysis of clinical data generated in a study, from post market data or through in vitro testing simulations under clinically relevant conditions. NOTE In practice, it is not possible to predict accurately the actual lifetime of an individual implant. It is well understood that several factors are beyond the control of the manufacturer. These factors can have a significant effect on the lifetime of an individual device. The factors include the actual implantation procedure, the anatomy and state of health of the patient, the behaviour and activities (e.g. sporting activities), as well as predictable and unpredictable external mechanical influences.
