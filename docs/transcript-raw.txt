2 minutes 18 seconds2:18
Bharath Kumar V 2 minutes 18 seconds
Yeah, that I I'll go to that one. I'll ask Sai Sai you can bring it up that by the time I'll finish this. So this is the the medium one. So compared to the previous one here you will add get a collaboration and create layout. English and electronic translation will be added here which is additional 3 weeks.
Bharath Kumar V 2 minutes 36 seconds
And same.
Bharath Kumar V 2 minutes 38 seconds
You can have the a translation outsource approval is also there and then approval change order will be there so that will be additional. So it is taking 6 to 8 months for the medium process. So this is the third one which they're having a high complexity which is the complete all the creations of labels, redlining, mockup, layout.

Bharath Kumar V
3 minutes 15 seconds3:15
Bharath Kumar V 3 minutes 15 seconds
That is our proposal. I'd say that is our L&T proposal compared to the other other as per our experience in the other projects we proposed in silly right now this this 12 steps has been maybe you can consider this is a 20 steps.

Durga Kothapalli
3 minutes 19 seconds3:19
Durga Kothapalli 3 minutes 19 seconds

Suraj Dubey
10 minutes 9 seconds10:09
Suraj Dubey 10 minutes 9 seconds
No, no, no Durga red line is priority. I would say yes, it is priority. Bharath mean to say red line is not fixed to update only one thing. It's like based on the regulatory comments, we have to update the red line Bharath.
BV
Bharath Kumar V
10 minutes 9 seconds10:09
Bharath Kumar V 10 minutes 9 seconds
Priority though God, that's what I'm telling.

10 minutes 12 seconds10:12
Durga Kothapalli 10 minutes 12 seconds
OK.
Durga Kothapalli 10 minutes 24 seconds
That's fine. That that's fine. That becomes requirement for me, right? So it is not the one standard thing. It is where is bain by regulatory. So regulatory is my truth. So I need to look at that and based on that I need to work on what need to be redlined.

Suraj Dubey
10 minutes 28 seconds10:28
Suraj Dubey 10 minutes 28 seconds
Yes.
Suraj Dubey 10 minutes 32 seconds
Yeah.
Suraj Dubey 10 minutes 40 seconds
Exactly. That is the right answer or right question, yes.

Durga Kothapalli
10 minutes 40 seconds10:40
Durga Kothapalli 10 minutes 40 seconds
Right, the type of the label.
Durga Kothapalli 10 minutes 43 seconds
So what I'm asking is OK then OK then we are final with the redlining. OK, next steps is I would like to know maybe a use case or something. Walk us, walk us through me and Ajay, what is the steps involved high level and what are the things actually is going to be done regularly?
Durga Kothapalli 11 minutes 2 seconds
So every label is different based on corresponding regulatory thing. So just walk us through and so that we can design a system for it.

Suraj Dubey
11 minutes 8 seconds11:08
Suraj Dubey 11 minutes 8 seconds
